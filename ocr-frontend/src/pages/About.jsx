              The Tamil Documents Digitalization System is an innovative
              solution designed to convert Tamil books in PDF format into
              editable and searchable text. With the growing need to preserve
              and modernize traditional literature, this system bridges the gap
              between printed Tamil texts and digital accessibility. By
              transforming non-editable content, it ensures that Tamil books are
              easier to access, search, and edit in the digital era.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-gray-600">
              At the core of the system is advanced Optical Character
              Recognition (OCR) technology, which automates text extraction from
              PDF files. To guarantee the highest level of accuracy, the
              OCR-processed text undergoes a rigorous multi-level validation
              process involving human proofreaders and administrators. This
              meticulous review ensures that digitized content remains true to
              its original form, maintaining cultural and linguistic integrity.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-gray-600">
              The system promotes collaboration by allowing users to contribute
              Tamil books and participate in the review process. With a focus on
              user-friendly access and cultural preservation, the Tamil
              Documents Digitalization System serves readers, researchers, and
              enthusiasts, making Tamil literature readily available in editable
              and searchable formats for generations to come.

            The User has several capabilities within the system. They can update
            their profile and delete their account at any time. Additionally,
            users can upload new books, edit the books theyâ€™ve added, and delete
            them if needed. Once a book is added, it goes through a two-stage
            review process, where it is checked for accuracy and quality by
            reviewers. After being reviewed twice, the book requires approval
            from the *Admin* before it is made public. This ensures that all
            content is thoroughly verified for accuracy before being shared with
            the public.
